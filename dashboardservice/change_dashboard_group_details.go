// Dashboards API
//
// Use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Dashboards service API to manage dashboards in the Console.
// Dashboards provide an organized and customizable view of resources and their metrics in the Console.
// For more information, see Dashboards (https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Dashboards/home.htm).
// **Important:** Resources for the Dashboards service are created in the tenacy's home region.
// Although it is possible to create dashboard and dashboard group resources in regions other than the home region,
// you won't be able to view those resources in the Console.
// Therefore, creating resources outside of the home region is not recommended.
//
